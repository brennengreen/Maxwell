  <h3 align="center">Maxwell</h3>

  <p align="center">
    A rendering "engine" which is good at one thing, being used elsewhere.

    The entire purpose of this "engine" is to be used as a template to build my later projects.
    Maxwell implements a simple windowing application can calls the Maxwell run function,
    this function sets up basic imgui components and then calls a renderpass.

    In the renderpass it is expected that some other engine will be called to render
    specific components from a project. Such as a particle system, voxel engine, raymarcher, etc.

    This gives me the advantaged of being able to use all my projects in a "cross-platform" manner
    in which they should be able to interact with each other.
